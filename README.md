# advent-of-code

My solutions to Advent Of Code challenges. I doubt I'll ever be in the top 100, but I'm doing this for fun and to learn. I do compare my solutions with others, but only after I have solved the problem myself and only to learn from others' solutions. I am definitely not trying to copy anyone's solutions.

## How did I get started with Advent of Code? 

I am nearing retirement. I have six (6) adult kiddos and the eldest four are all software developers. I never pushed them to the profession. They all got there following unique paths. Each of them is far more more talented and skilled than I ever hoped to be. 

While visiting with two of them in early November 2022, they suggested I join them for this year's Advent of Code (AoC). Having never even heard of AoC, I asked a few questions. I was instantly intrigued by the idea. So, I decided to take them up on their offer. Now, after 3 days, I am hooked. Oh, and I am currently at the top of our Private Leaderboard. We'll see how long that lasts...

I will try to add solutions for the current year's AoC event as I complete them. 

Also, I have included my solutions for some previous years' Advent of Code challenges. I have been going back and doing a few of these to help familiarize myself with AoC's "strategy". I may continue to add solutions for these previous years, but there's no guarantee.
