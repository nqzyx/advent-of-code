# [Advent of Code (AoC)](https://adventofcode.com)

This repository contains my solutions to AoC challenges. I doubt I will ever be anywhere near the top 100, especially now that ChatGPT and other AI tools are around. However, I am doing this for fun and to learn. I do compare my solutions with others' solutions, but only after I have solved the dproblem myself and only to learn from their techniques. I am definitely not copying solutions from anyone.

## How did I get started with AoC? 

If you have read [About Me ðŸš« (TL;DR; strongly discouraged!)](https://github.com/nqzyx/nqzyx/ABOUTME.md), you will know that I am an old guy... a fossil... a relic. You also may remember that I have six adult children, four of whom are software developers.

In earliy November 2022, While visiting with two of my software-developing progeny, the conversation turned to what we do -- as it inevitably does. After a few minutes, one (or both?) of them suggested I join them and their siblings for this year's AoC. Having never even heard of AoC, I had a few questions -- which they answered immediately. I was instantly intrigued by the idea and decided to take them up on their offer.

Last year's AoC cleaned my clock starting around Day 15. Still, I managed to outperform the more youthful competitors on my team, but not by much in the later days of my participation. For various reasons, this year only my eldest is interested in participating in AoC. As a means of spending a bit more time together, we have decided to use the AoC event in an off-the-record way. We will be working through the daily challenges _**together**_ rather than separately. Too, we are both interested in learning a big of [Go](https://go.dev/]. So, we'll be tackling the daily challenges using the extraordinarily popular language developed at Google many years ago. We'll see how this goes. Prior to the start of the 2023 Advent of Code, I am going back and working some of the easier challenges from earlier years in Go to get a feel for the language. At the moment, I'm on 2016 Day 1... 

### 12-Dec-2022

After 9 days, I am squarely atop the private leaderboard with my software-developing progeny. In all fairness, I don't sleep much any more, I don't have children at home, and outside of work and tending our small farm and reselling busines, I don't do much else these days... Wait, suddenly, that sounds like a lot... LOL!

I am posting my solutions here as a public recod of my efforts. Please be kind. I will be the first to admit that they are neither the most succint nor the most elegant. I only began to develop in Javascript in 2020 and I still have much to learn. Sometimes, I feel like my solutions are the proverbial sledgehammer squashing a fly. 

I also freely admit to using third-party libraries (e.g., [math.js](https://mathjs.org/docs/datatypes/matrices.html) and [djikstrajs](https://github.com/tcort/dijkstrajs)), but only where they provide utilitarian solutions for common algorithms. Unlike the early days of my career, modern software engineering relies on "standing on the shoulders" of those who came before you by making use of available libraries that can significantly shorten the time required to build a solution. 

### 03-Dec-2022

Today, after 3 days of participation in AoC's 2022 event, I am hooked! Oh... and I am currently at the top of our Private Leaderboard! (We will see how long that lasts...)

I will try to add solutions for the current year's AoC event as I complete them. 

Also, I am including my solutions for some previous years' Advent of Code challenges which I have been completing to help familiarize myself with AoC's "style" of challenges. This is proving very helpful and educational. I may continue to add solutions for these previous years, but there's no guarantee.
