# advent-of-code

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (hereinafter referred to as AoC) challenges. I doubt I will ever be anywhere near the top 100, but I am doing this for fun and to learn. I do compare my solutions with others' solutions, but only after I have solved the problem myself and only to learn from their techniques. I am definitely not trying to copy anyone's solutions.

## How did I get started with AoC? 

Bear with me, this is a long story. 

I have been programming for a very long time -- more than four (4) decades. I started in my college days in the late 1970's when programming languages were almost never cross-platform or, when they were, had special syntax on each platform. These languages changed only once every few years. It was a far cry from today's world of software development. I was first paid to write software in 1980 or 1981 when I wrote a retail inventory program for a college professor who owned a boot store using AppleSoft BASIC on an Apple IIe. I cannot remember how much I was paid for that code, but I had found my passion.

Now, I should say that I have never been a competitive programmer. I have always been more interested in building things than solving puzzles. I have also never been a big fan of competitive programming contests for whatever reason.

These days, I am approaching retirement. Among my six (6) adult offspring there are four (the eldest) who are software developers. I never pushed them toward this profession. In fact, they all traveled unique paths to get here.

  - One started coding in a high school work-study program, never considered anything else, and is now a world-class open source visionary in the space industry. 
  - Another, after completing a CS degree, interned with Amazon and then went to work for a consulting agency and is now an accomplished technical and team lead. 
  - Yet another completed a degree in Spanish, studied abroad, taught high school Spanish -- rising to department head -- and then decided to leave education, go through an intensive Code Camp -- with the remaining sibling -- and then switched careers becoming an accomplished full-stack developer in the educational software space.
  - The fourth took a while to find themselves, but eventually went through the aforementioned Code Camp and is now a talented full-stack developer specializing in data visualation for a major news organization. 

Each of them makes me proud and each is far more more talented and skilled than I had ever hoped to be... and who knows, maybe the remaining two will follow in their footsteps someday. You never know...

While visiting with two of my software-developing kiddos in early November 2022, conversation turned to what we do -- as it inevitably does. After a few minutes, they suggested I join them for this year's AoC. Having never even heard of AoC, I had a few questions -- which they answered. I was instantly intrigued by the idea. So, I decided to take them up on their offer. 

## 2022

Today, 03-Dec-2022, after 3 days of participation, I am hooked! Oh... and I am currently at the top of our Private Leaderboard! (We will see how long that lasts...)

I will try to add solutions for the current year's AoC event as I complete them. 

Also, I am including my solutions for some previous years' Advent of Code challenges which I have been completing to help familiarize myself with AoC's "style" of challenges. This is proving very helpful and educational. I may continue to add solutions for these previous years, but there's no guarantee.
